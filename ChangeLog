	Update changelogs of all components for 0.11 release

	Bump required version of libfso-glib to 2012.05.24.1

2012-05-22  Simon Busch  <morphis@gravedo.de>

	Merge branch 'master' into 0.11

	Set log level of all configurations for each component to INFO rather than DEBUG
	We're trying to ship all time production ready software which should only log in INFO
	level and not in debug mode.

	Enter release mode for all components

2012-05-11  Simon Busch  <morphis@gravedo.de>

	Use ustar format for the distribution tar archive in all components of the stack
	If we're not using ustar format for the tar archives we're getting problems when trying to
	package files with a path longer than 99 characters which isn't supported by the default
	tar format but by the ustart one.

2012-05-09  Simon Busch  <morphis@gravedo.de>

	Bump required fso-glib version of all components to 2012.14.1

	Bump required vala version of all components to 0.14.2

	fsousaged: dbus_service: fix two bugs with resource status update handling
	- resource send two status updates when requested by a user; one with refcount = 0 and one
	  with refcount = 1 (but status still the same)
	- resource send no status update when it's requested by more than one user and one of this
	  disappeared or released the resource

2012-01-27  Simon Busch  <morphis@gravedo.de>

	Bump required vala version of all components to 0.14.1 (which is wrong anyway)
	We're requiring at least vala 0.14.1 but in reality we need a bit more. There is currently
	a version 0.14.1.9 distributed by ourself which contains everything we need to compile the
	complete FSO stack with vala-0.14. You find it at
	http://downloads.freesmartphone.org/vala-0.14.9.tar.bz2

	fsousaged: lowlevel_kernel26_staysalive: make suitable for the upcoming vala 0.14.2

2011-12-21  Simon Busch  <morphis@gravedo.de>

	fsousaged: herring: adjust for recent changes to power management regarding android devices

2011-12-18  Simon Busch  <morphis@gravedo.de>

	fsousaged: dbus_service: initialize array object as early as possible to avoid segfaults

	fsousaged: dbus_service: mention wakelock support when enabled

	fsousaged: conf: add wakelock support for herring machine

	fsousaged: lowlevel_android: rework to support new suspend/resume handling for android influenced devices
	This removes the powerkey handling too. Handling system wakeup when the power key is
	pressed should be done somewhere else and the usage subsystem will be triggered via the
	org.freesmartphone.Usage.Resume method to completely wakeup.

	fsousaged: dbus_service: rework to support suspend/resume handling on android based devices

	fsousaged: dbus_service: adjust signature of resume method to catch up with the specification
	The FSO API specification requires two parameters for the resume method of the usage
	service: One for the source and one for the reason. This implements only the parameters so
	we can call the resume method correctly from the outside but we're not using both
	parameters atm.

2011-12-12  Simon Busch  <morphis@gravedo.de>

	fsousaged: lowlevel_android: refactor screen resume handling into own method

	fsodeviced: lowlevel_android: cleanup code a bit and comment unused parts to avoid compiler warnings

	fsousaged: lowlevel_android: make resume reason for modem a config option
	Not on every device the resume reason for modem activity is named SMD_RPCCALL. This is
	mostly the case on MSM devices but for example not for the Nexus S from Samsung.

2011-11-30  Simon Busch  <morphis@gravedo.de>

	fsousaged: lowlevel_kernel26_staysalive: adjust for changes to posix.vapi in latest vala versio

	fsousaged: lowlevel_android: adjust for changes to posix.vapi in latest vala version

2011-11-24  Simon Busch  <morphis@gravedo.de>

	Bump required vala version of all components to 0.14.0

2011-11-22  Simon Busch  <morphis@gravedo.de>

	Bump required vala version of all FSO components to 0.12.1

2011-11-10  Klaus Kurzmann  <mok@fluxnetz.de>

	fsousaged: drop the unneeded cmd var from Shutdown and Reboot commands

2011-11-09  Klaus Kurzmann  <mok@fluxnetz.de>

	fsousaged: make shutdown and reboot commands configurable
	We can't rely on PATH being correct when being activated via dbus.
	This means we better use absolute paths to the commands to
	execute.

	This adds two new config options in [fsousage]: shutdown_command and
	reboot_command. If not configured they default to '/sbin/shutdown -h now'
	and '/sbin/shutdown -r now'.

2011-10-16  Denis 'GNUtoo' Carikli  <GNUtoo@no-log.org>

	fsousaged: herring config: fix real suspend's resume
	Without that fix Xorg doesn't come back after a real suspend.

2011-10-09  Denis 'GNUtoo' Carikli  <GNUtoo@no-log.org>

	fsousaged: configuration: switch the herring machine to android low level plugin
	Herring is also known as crespo or nexus S

2011-09-28  Simon Busch  <morphis@gravedo.de>

	fsousaged: add configuration for herring machine (also known as nexus s)

2011-08-22  Simon Busch  <morphis@gravedo.de>

	fsousaged: dbus_service: when resume is not user initiated display should not turn on
	In cases where the resume is not initiated by the user (for example the device wakes up by
	some messages arrived on the modem channel) it's not right to turn on the display (which
	is the case in the idle idle state but not in the lock idle state).

2011-08-19  Simon Busch  <morphis@gravedo.de>

	fsousaged: lowlevel_palmpre: minor bug fixes
	- "UNKNOWN" is now handled as invalid resume reason
	- only the first resume reason is read from /sys/power/wake_event_list

2011-07-12  Simon Busch  <morphis@gravedo.de>

	fsousaged: dbus_service: increase time we're waiting for resource registration

	fsousaged: sync all configuration files with new configuration option

	fsousaged: add myself to the authors list

	fsousaged: dbus_service: remove unreached break statement

	fsousaged: dbus_serivce: make shadow resource handling finally work
	If a shadow resource is pinged but never registers its resource the daemon will not die
	anymore. It will wait for about 10 seconds for the resource to register and then abort
	resource enablement process.

	fsousaged: dbus_service: improve the code with more comments and exception handling

2011-07-11  Simon Busch  <morphis@gravedo.de>

	fsousaged: dbus_service: clean up dependency handling code

	fsousaged: dbus_service: catch unhandeled exception otherwise the daemon will die

	fsousaged: dbus_service: implement two debug options available through configuration
	You can now disable lowlevel suspend with the configratuion debug_do_not_suspend = true in
	the fsousaged.conf configuration file. Together with this you can set the resume reason
	with debug_suspend_user_initiated = true/false.

	fsousaged: dbus_service: forward all possible errors to the caller

2011-07-10  Simon Busch  <morphis@gravedo.de>

	fsousaged: dbus_services: some minor bug fixes for resource dependency handling

	fsogsmd/fsousaged: some minor corrections about resource dependency handling

	fsousaged: dbus_service: implement handling of resource dependencies

2011-06-29  Simon Busch  <morphis@gravedo.de>

	fsousaged: dbus_service: even respect shadow resources when doing the suspend
	Not enabled shadowed resources have the state UNKNOWN. When doing a suspend this always
	fails as the code checks only for a state not equal to SUSPENDED or ENABLED. This adds the
	check for the UNKNOWN state to be able to suspend the device when shadowed resources are
	not enabled.

	fsousaged: dbus_service: add some more debug statements in resource class

2011-06-27  Denis 'GNUtoo' Carikli  <GNUtoo@no-log.org>

	fsousaged: nexusone's config: activate suspend(remove debug_do_not_suspend)
	Now that we have implemented the screen userspace resume, we can suspend/resume.

	nexusone's fsousaged.conf: add userspace screen resume config

	fsousaged: lowlevel_android plugin: add support for userspace screen resume
	Add that in the [fsousage.lowlevel_android] fsousaged configuration section to activate it:
	screen_resume_type = userspace
	screen_resume_command = chvt 1;chvt 2

	fsousaged: lowlevel_android plugin: Whitespace and cleanup fix

2011-06-07  Denis 'GNUtoo' Carikli  <GNUtoo@no-log.org>

	Add nexusone configurations files.

2011-06-02  Simon Busch  <morphis@gravedo.de>

	Bump required vala version of all components to 0.12.0

	Revert "fsousaged: enable shadow resources for palm_pre machine"
	This reverts commit 81d1ac9905479153a20f3ab0f81acc79b905901e.

	Enabled shadow resources leads to errors within the SHR distribution. We need to solve
	this problem later. For now we will ship a separate config file for fsousaged in OE for
	the aurora distribution.

	Tested-by: Denis 'GNUtoo' Carikli <GNUtoo@no-log.org>
	Acked-by: Denis 'GNUtoo' Carikli <GNUtoo@no-log.org>

2011-03-06  Denis 'GNUtoo' Carikli  <GNUtoo@no-log.org>

	Move htcleo's config
	I carefully reviewed the commit c65d801ba4abfd09ee49f3c4a89823679c090bf9
	  But I looked at the content, not at the pathes.
	This fixes the pathes.

	Note that the config is not activated yet in the autotools build system.

2010-06-09  Antonio Ospite  <ospite@studenti.unina.it>

	Cosmetics: remove trailing spaces
	Changes are purely cosmetics, I generated them with this command:
	  find . -type f ! \( -path '*/.git/*' -or -name COPYING \) | \
	  xargs sed -e 's/[[:blank:]]*$//g' -i
	I had to take care to not mangle .git objects; this works also because there
	are no binary files in the repository, if there were any, then some other
	attentions should have been taken into account.

2010-05-31  Michael 'Mickey' Lauer  <mickey@vanille-media.de>

	fsousaged: lowlevel_android: -ERESTARTNOHAND is not being delivered to the application, but rather intercepted by glibc :/

	Fix using AC_ARG_ENABLE
	Macro: AC_ARG_ENABLE (feature, help-string, [action-if-given],
	[action-if-not-given]) works litte different as cornucopia expect:
	1. action-if-given called when --enable-feature or --disable-feature
	2. if it was --enable: $enableval="yes"
	   if it was --disable: $enableval="no"
	3. action-if-not-given is place for default value

	fsousaged: put bug number in pp command

	fsousaged: catch up with dbus async changes
	Async dbus changes have changed our timing so that fsousaged's dbus methods
	were not being carried out synchronously, which is what we want in the case
	of requesting/releasing/configuring resources. This should fix it,
	but may introduce other timing instabilities, so take a close look on
	unexpected behaviour.

2009-11-15  Michael 'Mickey' Lauer  <mickey@vanille-media.de>

	fsodeviced: call org.freesmartphone.IdleNotifier.SetState( ... ) on resume. lowlevel_openmoko: properly recognize reason and subreason.

	fsousaged: for some reason, my constructors were not called. use 'construct' to work around for now

2009-08-13  Michael 'Mickey' Lauer  <mickey@vanille-media.de>

	fsousaged: lowlevel_openmoko: detect reason and subreason from sysfs

	fsousaged: controller: use DBus constants as defined in fsoframework-2.0.vapi

	fsousaged: controller: infrastructure for lowlevel plugin done. To add a certain plugin as lowlevel suspend/resume plugin, you have to do the following: 1.) Make it loaded at all by adding its name to the conf file, e.g. [fsousage.lowlevel_kernel26] or [fsousage.lowlevel_openmoko] 2.) Chose which plugin to use for suspend/resume in [fsousaged] by adding (e.g.) lowlevel_type = kernel26 NOTE: kernel26 is the default, if the lowlevel_type entry is not present.

	fsousaged: add skeleton for lowlevel plugins implementing suspend/resume handling

	fsousaged: remove warnings and secure against more potential failures

	fsousaged: check for invalid parameters in {Get|Set}ResourcePolicy

2009-06-22  Michael 'Mickey' Lauer  <mickey@vanille-media.de>

	fsousaged: fix resource policy handling; since we can't use the enumeration code in here, it always transferred 0 instead of the real value :/

2009-06-14  Michael 'Mickey' Lauer  <mickey@vanille-media.de>

	fsousaged: controller: use FreeSmartphone.UsageSystemAction enum

	fsousaged: controller: request/release done for simple cases

	fsousaged: controller: unregister resources when the provider quits the bus

	fsousage: Bummer! We can't use libfso-glib for the server implementation in cases where we do special tricks like dealing with the dbus sender name or (eventually) async processing. Need to think whether we can convey the additional information other than by modifying the method signature :(

	fsousage: fix binary name
